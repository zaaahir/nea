    \emph{We ought not to be ashamed of appreciating the truth and of acquiring it wherever it comes from, even if it comes from peoples distant and nations different from us. For the seeker of truth nothing takes precedence over the truth, and there is no disparagement of the truth, nor belittling either of him who speaks it or of him who conveys it. The status of no one is diminished by the truth; rather does the truth ennoble all.} \\ \medskip
    --- Abū Yūsuf Ya‘qūb ibn Ishāq al-Kindī,\\ On First Philosophy (ca. 833-842 AD)
