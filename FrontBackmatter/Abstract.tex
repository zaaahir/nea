\chapter*{Abstract}
This project is a bytecode virtual machine interpreter for the custom language C-, submitted as part of the requirements for the A Level Computer Science qualification. As part of the GUI requirements of the project we also include a playground for C-, where code is syntax highlighted, and can be executed while viewing the intermediate bytecode and virtual machine trace. Furthermore, our program will be focused more to use in mathematics by implementing an extensive mathematical standard library. This differentiates our product from a simple toy compiler to one that has use as both a \ac{CAS} and as a programming language.
